# Reinforcement Learning Library

## Preface

While searching for a new project, I found that [arewelearningyet.com](arewelearningyet.com), rust's
community tracker on developments in machine learning disciplines being available, marks
Reinforcement Learning as poorly developed. Although, as a sole developer, I have no time and 
experience to change this, it does lead me back to my roots in Machine Learning. Consequently, I 
want to develop a small Reinforcement Learning (RL) library that provides a simple interface for 
quickly implementing learning jobs.
